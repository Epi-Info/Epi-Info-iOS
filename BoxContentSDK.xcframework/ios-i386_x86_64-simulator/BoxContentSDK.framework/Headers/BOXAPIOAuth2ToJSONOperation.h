 * BOXAPIOAuth2ToJSONOperation is a concrete subclass of BOXAPIOperation. This operation makes unauthenticated
 * requests to the Box OAuth2 server to retrieve access and refresh tokens. This operation is used for the
 * [authorization code grant](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) and
 * [refreshing an acess token](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6).
 *
 * NSNotifications
 * ===============
 * Upon success and failure, this operation will broadcast an `NSNotification` on the default notification
 * center of type `BOXAuthOperationDidCompleteNotification`. This notification is used by BOXAPIQueueManager to assist
 * in locking during token refresh requests. You may listen to this notification in addition to the other
 * notifications in BOXOAuth2Session to manager a user's logged in state in your app.

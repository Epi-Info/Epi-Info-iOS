/**
 * BOXAuthorizationViewController is a UIViewController that displays a WKWebview
 * that loads the OAuth2 authorize URL. An app may present this view controller to
 * log a user in to Box.
 *
 * This view controller also has extra logic to handle various Single Sign-ON (SSO)
 * configurations which require special handling beyond what a web view provides.
 * SSO is a session/user authentication process that allows a user to provide his
 * or her credentials once in order to access multiple applications. It is widely
 * used by corporations and institutions to secure and simplify the authentication
 * process for their users.
 *
 * **Important**: This controller performs valuable cookie-related operations on deallocation,
 * as such it should not be kept it memory after it is dismissed.
 *
 * @warning This is the only part of the Box SDK that is specific to iOS. If you wish to
 *   include the Box SDK in an OS X project, remove this source file.

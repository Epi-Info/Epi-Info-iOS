 * Callbacks and typedefs
 * ======================
 * This class defines a number of block types for use in callback blocks. These are:
 *
 * <pre><code>typedef void (^BOXDownloadSuccessBlock)(NSString *fileID, long long expectedTotalBytes);
 * typedef void (^BOXDownloadFailureBlock)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error);
 * typedef void (^BOXAPIDataProgressBlock)(long long expectedTotalBytes, unsigned long long bytesReceived);</code></pre>
 *
 * **Note**: expectedTotalBytes may be `NSURLResponseUnknownLength` if the operation is unable to
 * determine the Content-Length of the download.

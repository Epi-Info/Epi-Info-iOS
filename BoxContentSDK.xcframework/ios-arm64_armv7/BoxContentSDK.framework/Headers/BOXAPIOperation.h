/**
 * BOXAPIOpertation is an abstract base class for all Box API call operations. BOXAPIOperation is
 * an NSOperation subclass. Because it is an abstract base class, you should not instantiate it
 * directly. BOXAPIOperation enforces its abstractness with calls to the macro `BOXAbstract` in
 * unimplemented methods. This macro will raise an `NSAssert` when `DEBUG=1`.
 * [BOXAPIOperations](BOXAPIOperation) may be enqueued on an NSOperationQueue using a
 * BOXAPIQueueManager. Subclasses of BOXAPIResourceManager should create instances of BOXAPIOperation
 * to execute API calls.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses of BOXAPIOperation that may be instantiated are:
 *
 * - BOXAPIOAuth2ToJSONOperation
 * - BOXAPIAppAuthOperation
 * - BOXAPIJSONOperation
 * - BOXAPIMultipartToJSONOperation
 * - BOXAPIDataOperation
 *
 * An API call is considered to have succeeded if it returns with an HTTP status code in the
 * 2xx range, with an exception made for 202. 202, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx are all treated as errors.
 *
 * BOXURLSessionTaskDelegate
 * ===========================
 * BOXAPIOperation instances issue API calls using NSURLSession. Each BOXAPIOperation acts
 * as the delegate for its own API call's session task. [BOXAPIOperations](BOXAPIOperation) are
 * not concurrent NSOperations, so they keep the runloop they are running on open during the
 * lifetime of the request to enable receiving delegate callbacks, with the exception of background tasks.
 *
 * By default, a BOXAPIOperation will buffer received data in memory to be proccessed after the connection
 * terminates. See BOXAPIDataOperation for a subclass that does not use this default behavior.
 *
 * Callbacks and typedefs
 * ======================
 * This class declares several block typedefs that are used throughout the SDK. These are:
 *
 * Success and failure callbacks for API calls expecting JSON responses:
 *
 *  <pre><code>typedef void (^BOXAPIJSONSuccessBlock)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSDictionary *JSONDictionary);
 * typedef void (^BOXAPIJSONFailureBlock)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error, NSDictionary *JSONDictionary);</code></pre>
 *
 * Success and failure callbacks for API calls expecting binary data responses:
 * 
 * <pre><code>typedef void (^BOXAPIDataSuccessBlock)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSData *bodyData);
 * typedef void (^BOXAPIDataFailureBlock)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error, NSData *bodyData);</code></pre>
 *
 *
 * **Note**: All callbacks are triggered on the same thread the BOXAPIOperation runs on. When these operations
 * are enqueued by a BOXAPIQueueManager, they are not executed on the main thread. If you wish to update the UI
 * in a callback, do so inside of a `dispatch_sync` block on the main thread.
 *
 * Subclassing Notes
 * =================
 * Subclasses must override the following abstract methods:
 *
 * - encodeBody:
 * - prepareAPIRequest
 * - processResponseData:
 * - performCompletionCallback
 *

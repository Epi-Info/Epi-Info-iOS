 * App Users are full-featured enterprise Box accounts that belong to your application not a Box user. Unlike typical Box accounts, 
 * these accounts do not have an associated login and can only be accessed through the Content API by the controlling application 
 * and associated Box User ID. This new user model allows your application to take advantage of groups, permissions, collaborations, 
 * comments, tasks, and the many other features offered by the Box platform.
 *
 * For more information the documentation is linked below.

 * BOXAPIAccessTokenDelegate allows developers to make network calls to their own servers to retrieve an access token
 * outside of the normal means of authentication (OAuth2).

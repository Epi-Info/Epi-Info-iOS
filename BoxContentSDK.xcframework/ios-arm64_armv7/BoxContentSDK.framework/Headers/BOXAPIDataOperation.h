/**
 * BOXAPIDataOperation is a concrete subclass of BOXAPIAuthenticatedOperation.
 * This operation receives binary data from the Box API which may be in the form
 * of downloads or thumbnails.
 *
 * API calls to Box may fail with a 202 Accepted with an
 * empty body on Downloads of files and thumbnails.
 * This indicates that a file has successfully been uploaded but
 * is not yet available for download or has not yet been converted
 * to the requested thumbnail representation. In these cases, retry
 * after the period of time suggested in the Retry-After header
 *
 * Callbacks and typedefs
 * ======================
 * This class defines a number of block types for use in callback blocks. These are:
 *
 * <pre><code>typedef void (^BOXDownloadSuccessBlock)(NSString *fileID, long long expectedTotalBytes);
 * typedef void (^BOXDownloadFailureBlock)(NSURLRequest *request, NSHTTPURLResponse *response, NSError *error);
 * typedef void (^BOXAPIDataProgressBlock)(long long expectedTotalBytes, unsigned long long bytesReceived);</code></pre>
 *
 * **Note**: expectedTotalBytes may be `NSURLResponseUnknownLength` if the operation is unable to
 * determine the Content-Length of the download.
 *
 * BOXAPIDataOperation supports both foreground and background downloads
 * By default, download is foreground unless associateId and destinationPath properties are provided

 *
 * **Note**: Creating an output stream to a file can be done easily using `NSOutputStream`:
 *
 * <pre><code>NSOutputStream *outputStream = [NSOutputStream outputStreamToFileAtPath:path append:NO];</code></pre>
 *
 * @warning If you are manually reading from this output stream (for example with
 * a `CFStreamCreateBoundPair`) do not let data sit in the stream or you risk causing
 * a large file to buffer entirely in memory.

 * Using outputStream to consume data will not allow the request to be executed in the background if the app is killed/suspended
